    Automatically maps well-known URL schemes to the appropriate remote
    providers in the ``snakemake.remote.*`` classes.  The returned objects
    should be interchangeable for most rules.  For example:

    download the referenced file to a local path and then substitute that local
    path as the new value of ``input`` when running the ``shell`` block.
